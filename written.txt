The common parts of Zygote and Chrome were analyzed as follows:

$ ./vm_inspector 180 >zygote.vm
$ cat /proc/180/maps >zygote.map
$ $ ./vm_inspector 2280 >chrome.vm
$ cat /proc/2280/maps >chrome.map
$ git diff --no-index zygote.vm chrome.vm | grep '^ ' >commonlines.vm
$ python comparitory.py >result.txt

Essentially, extract common lines of Zygote and Chrome analyzed by our
vm_inspector, and look for those virtual addresses in the proc-map of
either of them.

The files and comparitor.py can be found in the comparitor/ directory
of the repository.

According to result.txt, the common objects between zygote and chrome
linker, libraries, framework. Zygote's task is to set up a new
instance of the Dalvik VM for each new application launched; hence, it
shares these common setup items.
